# Learndjango

## Foreword
I have bundled [learndjango](https://learndjango.com/) tutorials into one project.  

## Introduction
This project allowed me to learn how to:  
- Sign up and log in with a mail and a password.   
- Create an app with which a user can upload images (posts).  
- Configure a Django project to use static files.  
- Create a custom user model  
- Create and run tests (for `posts` and `pages` apps).  
- Create a basic poll application (polls).  
- Create an email/contact form (contact).  
- Create an article app, and use slugs for urls purposes (articles).  
- Create a basic search engine (citysearch).  
- Have fun coding a Django project :)
